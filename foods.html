            <p>Koreans have great pride in their food and, despite</br> it becoming increasingly popular around the world</br> for its authentic dishes, nothing beats sampling it</br> in its country of origin. Vegetables are widely used</br> in everything from side dishes to mains along with</br> healthy doses of natural flavorings. </p>
