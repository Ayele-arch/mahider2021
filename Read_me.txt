Target group and Objective
The website serves to act as a means of inspiration for people who love to 
travel and experience new and unique cultures and environments. As the 
world is now becoming a global village, many people are interested in 
exploring new surroundings, and engaging with different people. This 
website tries to introduce to people in Ethiopia as well as all around 
the world about the great features of a country (South Korea, in this case), 
change their perspective of the country in question, and moreover, initiate 
their interest to become travelers and explorers who are ready to adapt and 
socialize with any society existing in the world.
